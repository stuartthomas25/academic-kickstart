Hi, I'm Stuart. I am an undergraduate student at [William & Mary](http://www.wm.edu/) majoring in physics and minoring in math. My research focuses on theoretical condensed matter, specifically Majorana fermions.

I love all things music (check out some of [my favorite albums](http://files.stuartthomas.us/albums/)) and serve as the president of the [William & Mary Fencing Club](https://fencing.blogs.wm.edu/).<a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.online/@stuartthomas"></a>
